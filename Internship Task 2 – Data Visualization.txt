🎛 Slicers (Filters)

To make the dashboard interactive, the following filters were added:
- 📍 Region
- 📦 Category
- 📅 Order Date

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Executive Summary                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Category: Technology has best profit margin   |
| ✅ Region: West leads in both profit & sales     |
| ✅ Segment: Corporate lags behind others         |
| ✅ Discount: Above 20% = Loss in most cases      |
+--------------------------------------------------+

 Executive Summary

✅ Technology category has the highest profit margin despite lower overall sales — a strong area for growth.

⚠️ Furniture drives high sales but delivers lower profitability, likely due to bulkier shipping and high discounting.

✅ The West region leads in both sales and profit, making it the most valuable geographic segment.

⚠️ High discounts (above 20%) are often linked to negative profits, especially in Office Supplies.

✅ Corporate segment lags in both sales and profitability compared to Consumer and Home Office.

📈 Sales trend shows consistent growth with seasonal spikes, suggesting strong customer engagement.
